* ![](/Volumes/GoogleDrive/My\ Drive/xSEL\ Labs/Scripts/Dashboards/Icons/Emotion\ Recognition\ Icon_smaller.png)
**Emotion Recognition**:  
Emotion recognition involves the ability to understand what others are feeling from their behavior. In everyday interactions, facial    expressions communicate what a person is feeling. For SELweb’s emotion recognition assessment, children see pictures of faces and indicate what each person is feeling. Some of the faces have very clear expressions; others are subtler. The more faces a child correctly labels, the higher their score.


* ![](/Volumes/GoogleDrive/My\ Drive/xSEL\ Labs/Scripts/Dashboards/Icons/Social\ perspective-taking_smaller.png)
**Social Perspective-Taking**:   
Social perspective-taking involves the ability to understand what someone else is thinking or intends, even when it is not obvious. For SELweb’s perspective-taking assessment, children listen to brief illustrated and narrated stories and answer questions about a story character’s actions. Getting the right answer requires them to understand the character’s underlying intentions. The more questions they answer right, the higher their score.
    
  
* ![](/Volumes/GoogleDrive/My\ Drive/xSEL\ Labs/Scripts/Dashboards/Icons/Problem-Solving_smaller.png)
**Social Problem-Solving**:   
Social problem-solving involves the ability to solve challenging everyday social problems. For SELweb’s social problem-solving assessment, students listen to brief illustrated and narrated stories about challenging situations. After each story, they answer questions about their interpretations, goals, and actions.
  
    
* ![](/Volumes/GoogleDrive/My\ Drive/xSEL\ Labs/Scripts/Dashboards/Icons/Self-Control\ Icon_smaller.png)
**Self Control**:  
Self-control includes the skills children use to control their attention, emotions, and behavior to achieve their goals. Two SELweb assessments measure different dimensions of self-control. One measures children’s ability to delay gratification and another measures their tolerance for frustration. Each child’s overall Self- Control score reflects the extent to which they score high on those two assessments.
